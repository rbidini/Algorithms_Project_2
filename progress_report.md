#### 1. Data Organization
- **Data Analysis**:
  - Understand the structure, fields, and data available.
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Identify and handle missing values and inconsistencies.
- **Data Decoding**:
  - Determine relationships between datasets.
  - Map equipment codes to corresponding plane models.

#### 2. Research
- **Capacity Research**:
  - Gather accurate capacity data for each plane model.
- **Algorithm Research**:
  - Investigate algorithms suitable for network analysis, focusing on route optimization, network connectivity, and flow capacity.

#### 3. Implementation
- **Graph Structure Ideas**:
  - **Nodes**: Represent airports with unique identifiers (e.g., IATA codes).
  - **Edges**: Create directed edges for flights from source to destination.
  - **Weights**: Use plane capacities.
- **Algorithm Implementation**:
  - Explore algorithms like DFS and BFS for basic connectivity analysis.
  - Investigate Network Flow Algorithms for advanced analysis.
  - _Note_: Main algorithm still to be determined.

#### 4. Testing
- Ensure the algorithm works as expected.
- Analyze performance, including time complexity.
- _Deadline_: TBD upon main algorithm completion.

#### 5. Dashboard Implementation
- Develop a user-friendly interface for data interaction and visualization.
- _Deadline_: TBD upon main algorithm completion.

#### 6. Final Report and Presentation
- Document project process, findings, and conclusions.
- Prepare a presentation summarizing key aspects.
- _Deadline_: 12-10-2023 (weekend before the final presentation).
